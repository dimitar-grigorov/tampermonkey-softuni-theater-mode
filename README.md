# SoftUni Theater Mode

This Tampermonkey script enhances the SoftUni.bg video streams by introducing a customizable theater mode. The script adds a floating button that allows users to expand the video stream for an immersive viewing experience. With a simple click, it toggles between hiding and revealing course information, providing flexibility based on user preferences.

## Features

1. **Initialization:** Identifies the main container element with the class "stream-container" on the SoftUni.bg video streams page.

2. **Floating Button:** Creates a floating button with a glyph icon, seamlessly integrated into the stream container.

3. **Theater Mode Toggle:** Clicking the button toggles a theater mode, adjusting the visibility of the "aside" element and toggling the width of the "stream-section" element.

4. **Button Styles:** The button is initially positioned with a default right offset and opacity, featuring smooth CSS transitions.

5. **Mouse Interaction:** The button's visibility and position dynamically respond to mouse movements, optimizing the user experience.

## Usage

Simply install the Tampermonkey script and enjoy an improved SoftUni.bg video streaming experience. The floating button makes it easy to switch between an expanded video view and a compact layout with course information.
